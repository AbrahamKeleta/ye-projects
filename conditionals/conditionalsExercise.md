# Conditionals


Python conditionals are statements that allow you to execute different pieces of code based on whether a certain condition evaluates to True or False. The primary conditional statements in Python are:

1. if statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is True.
2. else statement: It executes a block of code if the if condition is False.
3. elif statement: It stands for "else if" and allows you to check multiple conditions. If the condition in the if statement is False, it checks the condition in the elif statement. You can have multiple elif statements.
4. Nested conditionals: You can have conditionals inside other conditionals, creating nested structures to handle more complex logic.


Here's the basic syntax for Python conditionals:


```python



x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")

```
