# For Lopp Idea

What is a for loop?


A for loop is a control flow statement in programming languages that allows you to iterate over a sequence of elements (such as an array, list, or range of numbers) and perform a certain set of instructions repeatedly until the iteration is complete.

The basic structure of a for loop typically includes:

Initialization: It initializes the loop control variable.
Condition: It checks whether the loop should continue or terminate based on a certain condition.
Increment/Decrement: It updates the loop control variable after each iteration.
Body: It contains the statements to be executed in each iteration.
Here's a general syntax of a for loop in many programming languages:

Here is an example below: 


```python

def forLoop(): 
  for i in 0..5:
    print(i)

```

We have learned to create a document that breathes and lives and we can clone it using github. 

This is a test document that belongs to folder ye-projects, which can be renamed to a lesson or project we want YEs to present in immersion or CPP. 

Document can continue going down as long as it needs to. 


## Exercise 

Try this below: 

# Iterating over a list of numbers and calculating their sum

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum_of_numbers = 0

for num in numbers:
    sum_of_numbers += num

print("The sum of numbers is:", sum_of_numbers)

```

## Take Aways

1. Make sure everyone has completed example
2. Change the example and test it
3. Keep going
